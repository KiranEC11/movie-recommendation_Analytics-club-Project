The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough.

For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox</td>\n",

The film feels rushed and is poorly edited. There is a moment near the end of the film where a character says that they have 21 days till a bomb goes off. Then, literally in the next scene, they say they have 5 hours till the bomb goes. Apparently this film has a floating time line inside it's ridiculous running time. So many inconsistencies and plot holes that took me out of the film. Sure, the dark knight had some plot holes, but it never seemed to break the rules of the universe it was set in. This film breaks the rules established in the previous films in every scene. How did nearly every single cop in the city get lured into the sewers in the first place? They couldn't have a drone or a robot check and then send a swat team down? This film also has the distinction of being too long and not having enough in it. There must be scenes on the cutting floor that would've made some of the stranger and downright stupid parts of this film make more sense. The best parts of this film are the parts I was skeptical about. Hathaway's Catwoman is fantastic and fits well in this universe, as does the menacing Bane- who Tom Hardy emulates with very cold and haunted eyes. The fight scenes are great, and the acting is top notch. But something seems...Off. The writing is more on the nose than in the dark knight, and some parts don't add up. The pit in this movie seems like it belongs more in Inception.The ending to this movie is what really ruined it. Another race against the clock climax that's been done ten thousand times before. The 'twist' could have also been done better. The most disappointed I had ever been in a sequel until the force awakens was released. A 5 out of 10 for Chris Nolan's worst film.</td>\n",

It is already very hard to make a sequel for a film which was just good enough hit but to make a sequel for a film which will always be remembered as the best you have to do a very impeccable job and that is what is done in this movie. From the beginning to the end you have some very beautiful and emotional scenes like the mob fight between the police and the thugs, the rise of the Batman from the prison and the chants \"Deshi Deshi Basura Basura\" towards the end where Alfred and Bruce see each other for probably the last time and both know that he has made it.</td>\n",

The first hour or 90 minutes of this talking heads marathon plays out like a segment of LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND BORING. Maybe the Nolans haven't gotten the news, yet, but We ain't all that fond of watching the Rich wallow in their Riches over here. Where was the guy we came to see- the guy with the black leather body armor and the cape? Doing his impression of Howard Huge! Really? THAT'S what we came to see? (Not that that really matters: Batman gets outed yet again in this installment. Little wonder he doesn't bother to suit up...) Nolan's idea of an Occupy Movement says a lot, I think: the VILLAINS take over City Hall (or whatever it is in this monstrously slow-moving movie) and are set upon at film's end by Gotham's finest like peaceful protesters at a sit-in. The guy who plays Bane seems to be channeling Sean Connery, and Catwoman transmorgriphies, finally, into Batwoman. At least the worst-designed Batmobile in the 70-plus year history of the character has been laid to rest (not to mention the aerodynamically unsound piece of flying wreckage that's supposed to be the Batplane). (I've always thought that SPAWN was by far the worst-designed comic book character in comic book history- a mish-mash of ideas lifted from Spider-man and Doctor Strange-and a character whose name was ripped off from a Jack Kirby NEW GODS story- but the Batmobile in this trilogy made me step back and reevaluate things. Batman's wheels in these films look like slabs of scrap metal haphazardly fused or magnetized together. Hopefully, we've seen the last of them.) For future reference: filmmakers, if we pay money to see a super-hero movie, it's because we want to see the super-hero- NOT his UNsuper-heroic alter ego. Is THAT so hard to grasp?</td>\n",

The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough. If you haven't someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won't be disappointed.   \n",

Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master.   \n",
       "3  Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox   \n",

It's obvious that Mr. Nolan was forced into directing this movie so he could make interstellar. The film feels rushed and is poorly edited. There is a moment near the end of the film where a character says that they have 21 days till a bomb goes off. Then, literally in the next scene, they say they have 5 hours till the bomb goes. Apparently this film has a floating time line inside it's ridiculous running time. So many inconsistencies and plot holes that took me out of the film. Sure, the dark knight had some plot holes, but it never seemed to break the rules of the universe it was set in. This film breaks the rules established in the previous films in every scene. How did nearly every single cop in the city get lured into the sewers in the first place? They couldn't have a drone or a robot check and then send a swat team down? This film also has the distinction of being too long and not having enough in it. There must be scenes on the cutting floor that would've made some of the stranger and downright stupid parts of this film make more sense. The best parts of this film are the parts I was skeptical about. Hathaway's Catwoman is fantastic and fits well in this universe, as does the menacing Bane- who Tom Hardy emulates with very cold and haunted eyes. The fight scenes are great, and the acting is top notch. But something seems...Off. The writing is more on the nose than in the dark knight, and some parts don't add up. The pit in this movie seems like it belongs more in Inception.The ending to this movie is what really ruined it. Another race against the clock climax that's been done ten thousand times before. The 'twist' could have also been done better. The most disappointed I had ever been in a sequel until the force awakens was released. A 5 out of 10 for Chris Nolan's worst film.   \n",

The film contains everything, from brilliant acting, raw action, out of the world one-liners and amazing cinematography. It is already very hard to make a sequel for a film which was just good enough hit but to make a sequel for a film which will always be remembered as the best you have to do a very impeccable job and that is what is done in this movie. From the beginning to the end you have some very beautiful and emotional scenes like the mob fight between the police and the thugs, the rise of the Batman from the prison and the chants \"Deshi Deshi Basura Basura\" towards the end where Alfred and Bruce see each other for probably the last time and both know that he has made it.   \n",

The first hour or 90 minutes of this talking heads marathon plays out like a segment of LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND BORING. Maybe the Nolans haven't gotten the news, yet, but We ain't all that fond of watching the Rich wallow in their Riches over here. Where was the guy we came to see- the guy with the black leather body armor and the cape? Doing his impression of Howard Huge! Really? THAT'S what we came to see? (Not that that really matters: Batman gets outed yet again in this installment. Little wonder he doesn't bother to suit up...) Nolan's idea of an Occupy Movement says a lot, I think: the VILLAINS take over City Hall (or whatever it is in this monstrously slow-moving movie) and are set upon at film's end by Gotham's finest like peaceful protesters at a sit-in. The guy who plays Bane seems to be channeling Sean Connery, and Catwoman transmorgriphies, finally, into Batwoman. At least the worst-designed Batmobile in the 70-plus year history of the character has been laid to rest (not to mention the aerodynamically unsound piece of flying wreckage that's supposed to be the Batplane). (I've always thought that SPAWN was by far the worst-designed comic book character in comic book history- a mish-mash of ideas lifted from Spider-man and Doctor Strange-and a character whose name was ripped off from a Jack Kirby NEW GODS story- but the Batmobile in this trilogy made me step back and reevaluate things. Batman's wheels in these films look like slabs of scrap metal haphazardly fused or magnetized together. Hopefully, we've seen the last of them.) For future reference: filmmakers, if we pay money to see a super-hero movie, it's because we want to see the super-hero- NOT his UNsuper-heroic alter ego. Is THAT so hard to grasp?   \n",
